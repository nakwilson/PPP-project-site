                <p>Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.</p>
                <h3>Which Cat Foods Have All the Essential Nutrients?</h3>
                <p>An easy way to ensure that cats get all the nutrients they need is to only purchase foods that have an Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) statement of nutritional adequacy on their labels.</p>

                <p>Look for something along the lines of one of these two sentences:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that Yummy Cat Food provides complete and balanced nutrition for adult maintenance, growth and reproduction, or all life stages.</li>
                        
                        <li>Yummy Cat Food is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Cat Food Nutrient Profiles for adult maintenance, growth and reproduction, or all life stages.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <p>Newborn kittens receive complete nutrition from their mother&apos;s milk for the first four weeks of life. Mom's milk is perfect for their needs, so you don&apos;t need to feed them anything else.</p>
                <p>It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kitten&apos;s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube.</p>
                <p>During the first weeks of life, a kitten&apos;s body weight may double or even triple. This rapid growth will continue, albeit at a decreasing rate, until maturity. Large amounts of energy and nutrients are required in balanced quantities to support this spectacular growth.</p>

                <p>Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after birth. According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food.</p>
                <p>Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.</p>
                <p>Kittens can be fed free-choice—which means food is available at all times, as much as the pet wants, whenever the pet wants. You can feed them dry kitten food or nutrient-dense kitten-formula canned food—however, the free-choice method is most appropriate when feeding dry food, which will not spoil if left out. Also, make sure fresh water is available at all times.</p>

                <p>This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is not recommended to leave food out for the cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.</p>
                <p>A cat with a "normal" activity level should receive what we call "maintenance" energy. A cat who mostly lies around the house may require 10% below maintenance, while an active kitty who plays all day may require maintenance plus 20 to 40%. Your cat should always have free access to fresh, clean water. Water bowls should be cleaned every day.</p>
                <p>As a general rule of thumb, we recommend that all cats be fed twice daily. Start by dividing the amount suggested on the label of your pet’s food into two meals, spaced eight to twelve hours apart. You may need to adjust portions as you learn your cat’s ideal daily “maintenance” amount. Pet owners should consult with a <a href="contact.html">Pexpert</a> to determine the best feeding schedule and types of foods for their pets.</p>

                <p>Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and not just a category (such as fish). </p>
                <p>The main objectives in the feeding an older cat should be to maintain health and optimum body weight, slow or prevent the development of chronic disease, and minimize or improve clinical signs of diseases that may already be present. </p>
                <p>As a cat ages, health issues may arise, including deterioration of their skin and coat, loss of muscle mass, more frequent intestinal problems, arthritis, obesity, dental problems, and decreased ability to fight infections.</p>
